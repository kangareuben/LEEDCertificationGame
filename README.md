# LEEDCertificationGame

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards are one way of measuring the energy efficiency and sustainability of a building. LEED certification has four different levels: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. The level awarded to a building is determined by how many points the building's design and construction has earned. The goal of The LEED Certification Game is to drag components onto buildings to meet the specified LEED certification levels.
